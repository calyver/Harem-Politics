 consort_events.0001.t: "Unpleasant Meetings"
 consort_events.0001.desc: "As I take a stroll, I am greeted by [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName], a newcomer who has been favored by [partner.GetTitledFirstName]. Despite [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] low status, [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] is frivolous and willful, with most [partner.Custom('consorts_localization')] despising [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim].\n\n“Do you not wonder why [partner.GetTitledFirstName] ignores you to spend more time with me these days?” asks [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] with an arrogant smile. “No matter how much glory someone has, time passes and is unforgivable, right?”\n\nHow dare [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] mock my age? I have been tolerant towards [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim], but maybe [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] needs to learn a lesson, and I am [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] superior."
 
 consort_events.0001.a: "[valid_target_consort.GetSheHe|U] deserves strict punishment!"
 consort_events.0001.a_tt: "You will torture [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName]."
 consort_events.0001.b: "The belt will do."
 consort_events.0001.c: "That is no way for a [valid_target_consort.Custom('consort_localization')] to act."
 consort_events.0001.d: "[valid_target_consort.GetSheHe|U]'s not worth my time."
 
 #Hua Fei#
 consort_events.0002.t: "Unruly [partner.Custom('consorts_localization')|U]"
 consort_events.0002.desc: "On such a quiet day, I thought I'd take a walk in the gardens. Who would have thought that I would be interrupted by shouts and irreverent insults? When I look up, it's no one but [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] furiously yelling at [shen.GetTitledFirstName].\n\n“How dare you mock me?” says [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe].\n\nIn an impulsive move, [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] raises her fist and hits [shen.GetTitledFirstName]'s face, to the shock of those around them.\n\n[valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] is daring, as [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] rank doesn’t allow [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim] to discipline [partner.Custom('the_concubines_localization')]. If [shen.GetSheHe]’s indulged in [shen.GetHerHis] behavior, who knows how chaotic [partner.Custom('the_harem_lowercase_localization')] can be?"
 consort_events.0002.a: "Go investigate the matter."
 consort_events.0002.a_tt: "You will quell the situation."
 consort_events.0002.b: "People like [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim] will not go very far."
 
 consort_events.0003.consort.desc: "“I thought that only higher-ranked [partner.Custom('consorts_localization')] could discipline [partner.Custom('concubines_localization')],” I say as [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] and [shen.GetTitledFirstName] immediately bow. “If you’re managing [partner.Custom('the_harem_lowercase_localization')], I can now go rest.”"
 consort_events.0003.parent.desc: "“[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName] was just enjoying [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] morning walk,” says the servant escorting me as [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] and [shen.GetTitledFirstName] immediately bow. “That is until [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] heard your ruckus!”"
 consort_events.0003.end.desc: "\n\nRealizing [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] mistake, [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] quickly apologizes. “It was [shen.GetTitledFirstName] who was mocking me!”\n\n[valid_target_consort.GetSheHe|U] drowns [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim]self in petty excuses while blaming [shen.GetTitledFirstName]. Maybe it is time for [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim] to learn proper manners."
 
 #Badmouthing#
 consort_events.0004.desc: "I am walking with my attendants when suddenly I hear a laughing voice ranting and uttering insults.\n\n“I just don't know what [partner.GetTitledFirstName] saw in [target_consort.GetTitledFirstName],” [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] continues. “I am more worthy of [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] position.”\n\nSuch a poisonous tongue [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] has. With idle time, people do let their minds wonder carelessly. Maybe [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] needs something to focus on to forget talking about [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] superiors."
 consort_events.0004.a: "Fasting and a night prayer will teach [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim] respect."
 consort_events.0004.b: "[valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] will pray the whole night to repent."
 
 #Morning Greeting#
 consort_events.0005.t: "The Morning Greetings"
 consort_events.0005.des: "As the head of [partner.Custom('the_harem_lowercase_localization')], all of [partner.GetHerHis] [partner.Custom('consorts_localization')] must pay respects to me every morning. Although some delays may occur, it has become customary for [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] to come too late with a cocky expression.\n\n“This morning, [partner.GetTitledFirstName] wouldn't let me out of bed, that's why I'm late,” [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] says with arrogance. “I hope your honored self will not blame me for that.”\n\nWho does [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] think [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] is?! Not only do [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName]'s words encourage jealousy in [partner.Custom('the_harem_lowercase_localization')], but they also compromise the respect that [partner.Custom('consorts_localization')] have of me!"
 
 #Yanwan is signing#
 consort_events.0006.t: "Garden Muses"
 consort_events.0006.desc: "My quiet stroll is suddenly interrupted by an enchanting voice nearby. Upon hearing more, I realize that [yanwan.GetSheHe] is none other than [yanwan.GetTitledFirstName].\n\n[yanwan.GetSheHe|U] has been doing [yanwan.GetHerHis] best to curry favor lately, my servants even saying that [yanwan.GetSheHe] got [yanwan.GetHerHim]self a singing teacher to charm [partner.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nAlthough [partner.Custom('consorts_localization')] will do some tricks to gain favor, singing loudly while we are in mourning is certainly a great offense!"

 consort_events.0011.desc: "[partner.Custom('the_harem_lowercase_localization')|U] is a treacherous place where even blood siblings can turn against each other.

 consort_events.0013.desc: "No matter how favored a [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] and [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] child are, what lies ahead of their future depends on the child's future. [eligible_child.GetName] is such a talented [eligible_child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')]. [eligible_child.GetSheHe|U] would make a great [partner.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName]. It's not fair that another one will have this honor some day!\n\n[player_primary_heir.GetName]'s position in the succession line is not set in stone, however. As a [ROOT.Char.GetMotherFather], I must ensure my and my child's future."

 consort_events.0014.desc: "Lately, servants and [partner.Custom('consorts_localization')] alike greet me with reverence and show me great respect. No one dares to belittle me and I receive the most luxurious gifts in [partner.Custom('the_harem_lowercase_localization')], much to the jealousy of others! However, what can they do?

 consort_events.0014.a: "I'm favored!"
 
 #I'm unfavored#

 consort_events.0015.desc: "Day after day passes without a joy. It doesn't matter which position I have in [partner.Custom('the_harem_lowercase_localization')], [partner.GetTitledFirstName]'s coldness towards me translates into bullying by [partner.Custom('consorts_localization')] and servants alike.

 #Killing a higher-ranked consort#

To stabilize my place in [partner.GetHerHis] heart, some [partner.Custom('consorts_localization')] #italic must #! leave.\n\nAs the sun sets, my thoughts fixate on [valid_target_consort.

 #Ending a pregnancy#
 #Introductory event#

The consequences could be fatal, and anyone involved could face [partner.GetTitledFirstName]’s ire.\n\nIf I decide to continue, there are two options: giving her a strong poison that could end her pregnancy in quickly, with bigger risks of being caught; or slowly giving her herbs that may not do what I want."
