Despite [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] low status, [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] is frivolous and willful, with most consorts despising [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim].\n\n“Do you not wonder why [partner.GetTitledFirstName] ignores you to spend more time with me these days?” asks [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] with an arrogant smile. “No matter how much glory someone has, time passes and is unforgivable, right?”\n\nHow dare [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] mock my age? I have been tolerant towards [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim], but maybe [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe] needs to learn a lesson, and I am [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] superior."

When I look up, it's nobody but [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] furiously yelling at [shen.GetTitledFirstName].\n\n“How dare you mock me?” says [valid_target_consort.GetSheHe].\n\nIn an impulsive move, [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] raises her fist and hits [shen.GetTitledFirstName]'s face, to the shock of those around them.\n\n[valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] is daring, as [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] rank doesn’t allow [shen.GetHerHim] to discipline other concubines. If [shen.GetSheHe]’s indulged in [shen.GetHerHis] behavior, who knows how chaotic this harem can be?"
 consort_events.0002.a:0 "Go investigate the matter."

 consort_events.0003.end.desc: "\n\nRealizing [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] mistake, [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] quickly apologizes. “It was [shen.GetTitledFirstName] who was mocking me!”\n\n[valid_target_consort.GetSheHe|U] drowns [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim]self in petty excuses while blaming [shen.GetTitledFirstName]. Maybe it is time for [valid_target_consort.GetHerHim] to learn proper manners."

With idle time, people do let their minds wonder carelessly. Maybe [valid_target_consort.GetTitledFirstName] needs something to focus on to forget talking about [valid_target_consort.GetHerHis] superiors."
