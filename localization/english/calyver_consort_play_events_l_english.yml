 #Choosing an authority#
 consort_play.0004.t: "A Matter of Deference"
 consort_play.0004.desc: "Showing respect to those above me could strengthen alliances—or merely maintain the fragile balance in the harem.\n\nI take a moment to reflect on my options, knowing that each choice may bring consequences. Which authority shall I approach to pay my respects today?"
 consort_play.0004.a: "[homage_authority_1.GetTitledFirstName] is a natural choice"
 consort_play.0004.a.tt: "You will visit [homage_authority_1.GetTitledFirstName]"
 consort_play.0004.d: "None of them deserve my respect"

 consort_play.0005.desc: "One of my maids approaches, informing me that [homage_subordinate.GetTitledFirstName] is here to pay respects. As my subordinate, it is [homage_subordinate.GetHerHis] duty to show deference.\n\nYet, as [homage_subordinate.GetHerHis] superior, I can refuse [homage_subordinate.GetHerHis] visit to remind [homage_subordinate.GetHerHim] of [homage_subordinate.GetHerHis] place. The decision is mine."
 
 consort_play.0005.a: "Let [homage_subordinate.GetHerHim] in"

 #Someone pays respects to you#
 consort_play.0001.t: "A Show of Submission"
 consort_play.0001.desc: "Today, [homage_subordinate.GetTitledFirstName] approached me with deference, acknowledging my position as the head of [harem_liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s head consort.\n\nI could see the subtle glint of respect—or is it something more? [homage_subordinate.GetHerHis] gesture seems genuine, but in the harem, every move holds deeper meaning. Should I accept this gesture with grace, or remind [homage_subordinate.GetHerHis] who truly holds sway here?"
 consort_play.0001.a: "Serve me well, [homage_subordinate.GetTitledFirstName]"

 #You pay respect to someone#
 consort_play.0002.desc: "I stand before [homage_authority.GetTitledFirstName], the Main Spouse, acknowledging [homage_authority.GetHerHis] place above me.\n\n[homage_authority.GetTitledFirstName] gives a slight nod, acknowledging my presence. With that small gesture, I am dismissed from the hall, my thoughts swirling with the power we all play."
 consort_play.0002.a: "It is only my duty"
