 bride_show.0001.t: "The Consort Selection: Good Connections"
 bride_show.0001.desc: "As the time for candidate selection approaches, the air is filled with anticipation. Noble families from far and wide are gathering in my capital.\n\nThe court has asked me about the selection standards. Some insist that a candidate with a strong family lineage would strengthen our [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyNameNoTooltip] Dynasty’s standing. However, there are dissenting voices cautioning against this, fearing the undue influence of powerful families over the realm.\n\nIt is up to me whether family background will be important, considering the benefits and the risks."
 bride_show.0002.t: "The Consort Selection: The Fairest of Them All"
 bride_show.0002.desc: "The arrangements for the selection continue, my courtiers argue about the selection’s physical standards. .\n\nOn one hand, fair candidates are pleasant to be around with, and they can produce beautiful offspring. On the other hand, while appearance may catch the eye, lasting happiness and stability may be better ensured by focusing on inner qualities that last longer.\n\nThey fall silent and look at me, anxious to hear my thoughts on this."
 bride_show.0003.t: "The Consort Selection: The Essence Within"
 bride_show.0003.desc: "The selection is about to start, and the court eagerly awaits my decree on the candidates’ capabilities.\n\nSome argue for prioritizing candidates with a virtuous demeanor, and proficiency in multiple skills. Others suggest a more pragmatic approach, favoring other considerations over the candidates’ skills and behavior.\n\nThe choice is mine — seeking accomplished candidates or favoring other considerations."
